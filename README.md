# vWATCH64
You wrote your own code, you know what's going on behind the scenes.
But do you, really? What about those unexpected results you keep getting? What about the eventual crashing?

Don't you wish you could check the values of your variables, as they are modified in real time, without having to mess up your interface with temporary PRINTs?

###Well, pal, here's vWATCH64!

vWATCH64 is a real-time variable watch utility to help with debugging **programs written in QB64**. vWATCH64 automatically generates a customized library that is '$INCLUDED in a copy of your source file, allowing for real-time variable watch.

###With vWATCH64 you can:
- See variables values in real time.
- Know what SUB or FUNCTION is currently being run.
- Filter by DATA TYPE, Variable name or values.

Useful to help track bugs, check the execution of your code from inside, see what variables may not be necessary anymore.

You can also follow the development in [this topic](http://www.qb64.net/forum/index.php?topic=13275.msg114691#msg114691) on the official QB64 community.
